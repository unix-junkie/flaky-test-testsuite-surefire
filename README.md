=================================================
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/unix-junkie/flaky-test-testsuite-surefire.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unix-junkie/flaky-test-testsuite-surefire)

A collection of flaky and broken tests to check how your build server reports them.

Travis build is successful, as Travis CI is unable to detect that the test is only successful after N flakes within a single build.
